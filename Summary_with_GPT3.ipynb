      "Introduction\n",
      "Recent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\n",
      "ﬂexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\n",
      "vectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\n",
      "and contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to\n",
      "task-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have\n",
      "been directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\n",
      "This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\n",
      "question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\n",
      "and algorithms [RSR+19, LOG+19, YDY+19, LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\n",
      "the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\n",
      "strong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\n",
      "of examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\n",
      "First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\n",
      "applicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\n",
      "anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many\n",
      "of these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\n",
      "for every new task.\n",
      "Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\n",
      "of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\n",
      "ﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\n",
      "ﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\n",
      "generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\n",
      "can be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it\n",
      "[YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at\n",
      "human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\n",
      "Third, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural\n",
      "language (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number\n",
      "of demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often\n",
      "Figure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad\n",
      "set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize\n",
      "the desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within\n",
      "the forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a\n",
      "model would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded\n",
      "within a single sequence.\n",
      "3\n",
      " Figure 1.2: Larger models make increasingly efﬁcient use of in-context information. We show in-context learning\n",
      "performance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a\n",
      "natural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate\n",
      "improved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range\n",
      "of tasks.\n",
      "sufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing\n",
      "to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans\n",
      "to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy\n",
      "dialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality.\n",
      "One potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1 – which in the context of language models means\n",
      "the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities\n",
      "at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [RWC+19]\n",
      "attempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form\n",
      "of task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task\n",
      "and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n",
      "While it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example\n",
      "[RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind\n",
      "the state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of\n",
      "solving language tasks.\n",
      "Another recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer\n",
      "language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [RNSS18], to 300 million parameters\n",
      "[DCLT18], to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19],\n",
      "and ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [Tur20]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream\n",
      "NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a\n",
      "smooth trend of improvement with scale [KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and\n",
      "tasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong\n",
      "gains with scale.\n",
      "1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous:\n",
      "the method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time\n",
      "demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning”\n",
      "to capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner\n",
      "loop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many\n",
      "demonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model\n",
      "learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which\n",
      "we discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer\n",
      "loop structure.\n",
      "4\n",
      " Figure 1.3: Aggregate performance for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks While zero-shot performance\n",
      "improves steadily with model size, few-shot performance increases more rapidly, demonstrating that larger models are\n",
      "more proﬁcient at in-context learning. See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP\n",
      "benchmark suite.\n",
      "In this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call\n",
      "GPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets,\n",
      "as well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training\n",
      "set. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we\n",
      "allow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”,\n",
      "where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only\n",
      "an instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional\n",
      "ﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\n",
      "Figure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to\n",
      "remove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task\n",
      "description, and with the number of examples in the model’s context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically\n",
      "with model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and\n",
      "number of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no\n",
      "gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\n",
      "Broadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot\n",
      "setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held\n",
      "by ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in\n",
      "the one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\n",
      "zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\n",
      "relative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\n",
      "GPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning,\n",
      "which include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them\n",
      "deﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human\n",
      "evaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\n",
      "At the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This\n",
      "includes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE\n",
      "or QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we\n",
      "hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\n",
      "A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should\n",
      "not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n",
      "5\n",
      " We also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models\n",
      "on datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such\n",
      "content often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify\n",
      "its distorting effects. Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most\n",
      "datasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inﬂating results, and we either do not report results on these\n",
      "datasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.\n",
      "In addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion\n",
      "parameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most\n",
      "tasks we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap\n",
      "between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models\n",
      "are more proﬁcient meta-learners.\n",
      "Finally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and\n",
      "broader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3’s characteristics in this regard.\n",
      "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach and methods for training\n",
      "GPT-3 and evaluating it. Section 3 presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.\n",
      "Section 4 addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap). Section 5 discusses limitations of GPT-3.\n",

      "or paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of\n",
      "GPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed\n",
      "informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some\n",
      "datasets (such as PIQA [BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type\n",
      "“If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable\n",
      "gaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when\n",
      "evaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same\n",
      "way in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading\n",
      "comprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\n",
      "GPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused\n",
      "on exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both\n",
      "sample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional\n",
      "architectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent\n",
      "literature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard\n",
      "language models [RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks\n",
      "which empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back\n",
      "and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then\n",
      "generating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a\n",
      "few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves\n",
      "comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and\n",
      "RACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning\n",

      "few- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\n",
      "A more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether\n",
      "autoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the\n",

      "with self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas\n",
      "ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed\n",
      "actions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains\n",
      "of experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world\n",
      "[BHT+20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a\n",
      "different approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective\n",
      "function from humans [ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as\n",
      "images to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19].\n",
      "Another limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3\n",
      "takes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more\n",
      "text during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [Lin20]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is\n",

      "A limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot\n",

      "has learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that\n",
      "are drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format,\n",
      "to adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on\n",
      "this spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words\n",
      "seem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although\n",
      "possibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what\n",
      "humans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training\n",
      "and identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely\n",
      "how few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\n",
      "A limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are\n",
      "both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of\n",
      "models of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [HVD15] of large\n",
      "models down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills,\n",
      "most of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.\n",
      "Distillation is well-explored in general [LHCG19a] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters;\n",
      "new challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\n",
      "Finally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable,\n",

      "As mentioned in Section 2.2, we employed two techniques to improve the quality of the Common Crawl dataset: (1)\n",
      "ﬁltering Common Crawl and (2) fuzzy deduplication:\n",
      "1. In order to improve the quality of Common Crawl, we developed an automatic ﬁltering method to remove low\n",

      "to distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classiﬁer to re-sample Common Crawl by\n",
      "prioritizing documents which were predicted by the classiﬁer to be higher quality. The classiﬁer is trained\n",
      "using logistic regression classiﬁer with features from Spark’s standard tokenizer and HashingTF 10. For the\n",
      "positive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books\n",
      "corpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unﬁltered Common Crawl. We used\n",
      "this classiﬁer to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff\n",

      "We chose α = 9 in order to take mostly documents the classiﬁer scored highly, but still include some documents\n",

      "other documents) within each dataset using Spark’s MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the\n",

      "documents such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in\n",
      "which the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored 13−grams that matched more than 10 training\n",

      "whitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic\n",
      "tasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data\n",
      "marked as dirty are shown in Table C.1. Unlike GPT-2’s use of bloom ﬁlters to compute probabilistic bounds for test\n",
      "contamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps\n",
      "between test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our ﬁltered Common Crawl\n",
      "documents per Section 2.2.\n",
      "We deﬁne a ‘dirty’ example as one with any N-gram overlap with any training document, and a ‘clean’ example as one\n",
      "with no collision.\n",
      "Test and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed\n",
      "by this analysis, ﬁltering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it\n",
      "was infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling\n",
      "benchmarks plus the Children’s Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this\n",

      "Overlap results\n",
      "To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream\n",
      "tasks, we ﬁlter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report\n",
      "the relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2%\n",
      "worse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overﬁt to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is\n",
      "signiﬁcantly better, our ﬁltering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.\n",
      "This overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but\n",
